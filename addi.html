                                                    <p>Additative manufacturing, also known as 3D printing, is a process used to create a physical (or 3D) object by layering materials one by one based on a digital model. Unlike subtractive manufacturing that creates its final product by cutting away from a block of material, additive manufacture adds parts to form its final product. In the 1980s, 3D printing techniques were considered suitable only for the production of functional or aesthetic prototypes, and a more appropriate term for it at the time was rapid prototyping. As of 2019, the precision, repeatability, and material range of 3D printing have increased to the point that some 3D printing processes are considered viable as an industrial-production technology, whereby the term additive manufacturing can be used synonymously with 3D printing. One of the key advantages of 3D printing is the ability to produce very complex shapes or geometries that would be otherwise infeasible to construct by hand, including hollow parts or parts with internal truss structures to reduce weight. Fused deposition modeling (FDM), which uses a continuous filament of a thermoplastic material, is the most common 3D printing process in use as of 2020.</p>

In general, we know that terms stretch over time to include more than just their default meanings. Whatever the name, new ways of fabricating directly from bytes to stuff are radically changing the what, where, how, and when of making objects. What roles, then, do the two terms “additive manufacturing” and “3D printing” play in describing new ways of making?</p></dd>

                                              <dd><p>When MIT invented binder jet printing in the 1980s, they wrote: “three-dimensional printing is a process under development at MIT for the rapid and flexible production of prototype parts, end use parts, and tools directly from a CAD model.”
                                                Today our concept of “3D printing” is much broader, but the term is often associated with filament-based plastic printers, which are the pride and joy of many a hobbyist and self described maker. But there are also binder jet printers, laser metal 3D printers, as well as glass and clay 3D printers.

                                                milling. Otherwise, the term is less about the 3D printer itself, and more about the manufacturing process transformed by 3D printing.
                                                What is that transformation? AM changes the way we think about inventory and supply chain, taking parts from the point of manufacture to the point of use?
                                                AM is flexible in the time it takes to load a file, from anywhere in the world. It enables customized parts, in volume, and involves stocking raw materials like filament and printing spare parts on demand.

These constructs are added layer by layer in real time based on digital design. The simplicity and low cost of AM machines, combined with the scope of their potential creations, could profoundly alter global and local economies and affect international security.
