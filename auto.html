														<dt><p>
															Autonomic computing (AC) is distributed computing resources with self-managing characteristics, adapting to unpredictable changes while hiding intrinsic complexity to operators and users. Initiated by IBM in 2001, this initiative ultimately aimed to develop computer systems capable of self-management, to overcome the rapidly growing complexity of computing systems management, and to reduce the barrier that complexity poses to further growth.The AC system concept is designed to make adaptive decisions, using high-level policies. It will constantly check and optimize its status and automatically adapt itself to changing conditions. An autonomic computing framework is composed of autonomic components (AC) interacting with each other. An AC can be modeled in terms of two main control schemes (local and global) with sensors (for self-monitoring), effectors (for self-adjustment), knowledge and planner/adapter for exploiting policies based on self- and environment awareness. This architecture is sometimes referred to as Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute (MAPE).</p><p>
	
															Driven by such vision, a variety of architectural frameworks based on "self-regulating" autonomic components has been recently proposed. A very similar trend has recently characterized significant research in the area of multi-agent systems. However, most of these approaches are typically conceived with centralized or cluster-based server architectures in mind and mostly address the need of reducing management costs rather than the need of enabling complex software systems or providing innovative services. Some autonomic systems involve mobile agents interacting via loosely coupled communication mechanisms.</p></dt>
															<dt><p><h4>Characteristics of Autonomic Systems</h4></p></dt>
															<dd><p>An autonomic system can self-configure at runtime to meet changing operating environments, selftune to optimize its performance, self-heal when it encounters unexpected obstacles during its operation, and of particular current interest. Protect itself from malicious attacks. An autonomic
																system can self-manage anything including a single property or multiple properties. </p></dd>
																<dt><p><h4>Autonomic systems/applications exhibit eight defining characteristics:</h4></p></dt>
																<dd><p>➢ Open: An autonomic application/system must function in a heterogeneous world and
																	should be portable across multiple hardware and software architectures. Consequently, it must be built on standard and open protocols and interfaces.
																	</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Self-Optimizing: An autonomic application/system should be able to detect suboptimal behaviors and optimize itself to improve its execution.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Self-Healing: An autonomic application/system should be able to detect and recover from potential problems and continue to function smoothly.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Self-Protecting: An autonomic application/system should be capable of detecting and protecting its resources from both internal and external attacks and maintaining overall system security and integrity.</p></dd>
																
																
																
																	<dd><p>➢ Anticipatory: An autonomic application/system should be able to anticipate to the extent possible, its needs and behaviors and those of its context, and be able to manage itself proactively.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ Self-Configuring: An autonomic application/system should be able to configure and reconfigure itself under varying and unpredictable conditions.</p></dd>
																
																<dd><p>➢ Context-Aware: An autonomic application/system should be aware of its execution environment and be able to react to changes in the environment.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ Self-Awareness: An autonomic application/system “knows itself” and is aware of its state and its behaviors.</p></dd>
