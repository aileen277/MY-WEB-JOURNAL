														<dd><p><h4>➢ What do you think about computer vision? </h4></p></dd>
														<dd><p>It is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can be made to gain a high level understanding of digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to automate tasks that the human visual system can do.
															Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g. in the forms of decisions. Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action. This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.
															Another way to define computer vision is through its applications. Computer vision is building algorithms that can understand the content of images and use it for other applications.
															</p></dd>
															<dd><p><h4>How computer vision works</h4></p></dd>
															<dd><p>1.	Acquiring an image: Images, even large sets, can be acquired in real-time through video, photos or 3D technology for analysis.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>2.	Processing the image: Deep learning models automate much of this process, but the models are often trained by first being fed thousands of labeled or pre-identified images.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>3.	Understanding the image: The final step is the interpretative step, where an object is identified or classified.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>There are many types of computer vision that are used in different ways:</p></dd>
															<dd><p>➢ Image segmentation partitions an image into multiple regions or pieces to be examined separately.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>➢ Object detection identifies a specific object in an image. Advanced object detection recognizes many objects in a single image: a football field, an offensive player, a defensive player, a ball and so on. These models use an X, Y coordinate to create a bounding box and identify everything inside the box.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>➢ Facial recognition is an advanced type of object detection that not only recognizes a human face in an image but identifies a specific individual.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>➢ Edge detection is a technique used to identify the outside edge of an object or landscape to better identify what is in the image.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>➢ Pattern detection is a process of recognizing repeated shapes, colors and other visual indicators in images.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>➢ Image classification groups images into different categories.</p></dd>
															<dd><p>➢ Feature matching is a type of pattern detection that matches similarities in images to help classify them.
																Simple applications of computer vision may only use one of these techniques, but more advanced users, like computer vision for self-driving cars, rely on multiple techniques to accomplish their goal.
																</p></dd>
																<dd><p><h4>Applications of Computer Vision</h4></p></dd>
																<dt><p><h5>Computer vision is being used today in a wide variety of real-world applications, which include:</h5></p></dt>
																<dd><p>➢ Optical character recognition (OCR): reading handwritten postal codes on letters 
																 and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR);
																	</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Machine inspection: rapid parts inspection for quality assurance using stereo vision with specialized illumination to measure tolerances on aircraft wings or auto body parts 
																	 or looking for defects in steel castings using X-ray vision;
																	</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Medical imaging: registering pre – operative and intra – operative imagery or performing long-term studies of people’s brain morphology as they age;</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Fingerprint recognition and biometrics: for automatic access authentication as well as forensic applications.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Surveillance: monitoring for intruders, analyzing highway traffic, and monitoring pools for drowning victims;</p></dd>

														<dd><p><h4>History</h4></p></dd>
														<dd><p>The origins of computer vision go back to an MIT undergraduate summer project in 1966. It was believed at the time that computer vision could be solved in one summer, but we now have a 50- year old scientific field that is still far from being solved.
															Early experiments in computer vision took place in the 1950s, using some of the first neural networks to detect the edges of an object and to sort simple objects into categories like circles and squares. In the 1970s, the first commercial use of computer vision interpreted typed or handwritten
															text using optical character recognition. This advancement was used to interpret written text for the blind. As the internet matured in the 1990s, making large sets of images available online for analysis, facial recognition programs flourished. These growing data sets helped make it possible
															for machines to identify specific people in photos and videos.
