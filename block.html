														<dt><p><h4>➢ What do you think blockchain is all about? Just begin by defining the two words block and chain?</h4></p></dt>
														<dt><p>Originally blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked
															using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptography hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).
															A blockchain is, in the simplest of terms, a time-stamped series of immutable records of data that is managed by a cluster of computers not owned by any single entity. Each of these blocks of data (i.e. block) is secured and bound to each other using cryptographic principles (i.e. chain). “Blocks” on the blockchain are made up of digital pieces of information. Specifically, they have three parts:
															</p></dt>
															<dd><p>1.	Blocks store information about transactions like the date, time, and dollar amount of your most recent purchase from Amazon. (NOTE: This Amazon example is for illustrative purchases; Amazon retail does not work on a blockchain principle).</p></dd>
															<dd><p>2.	Blocks store information about who is participating in transactions. A block for your splurge purchase from Amazon would record your name along with Amazon.com, Inc.
																Instead of using your actual name, your purchase is recorded without any identifying information using a unique “digital signature,” sort of like a username.
																</p></dd>
																<dd><p>3.	Blocks store information that distinguishes them from other blocks. Much like you and I have names to distinguish us from one another, each block stores a unique code called a
																	“hash” that allows us to tell it apart from every other block. Let’s say you made your splurge purchase on Amazon, but while it’s in transit, you decide you just can’t resist and need a second one. Even though the details of your new transaction would look nearly identical to your earlier purchase, we can still tell the blocks apart because of their unique 
																	codes.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>4.	A transaction must occur. Let’s continue with the example of your impulsive Amazon purchase discussed in the introduction part of blockchain technology. After hastily clicking through multiple checkout prompt, you go against your better judgment and make a purchase.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>5.	That transaction must be verified. After making that purchase, your transaction must be verified. With other public records of information, like the Securities Exchange Commission, Wikipedia, or your local library, there’s someone in charge of vetting new data entries. With blockchain, however, that job is left up to a network of computers. These
																		networks often consist of thousands (or in the case of Bitcoin, about five million ) computers spread across the globe. When you make your purchase from Amazon, that network of computers rushes to check that your transaction happened in the way you said it did. That is, they confirm the details of the purchase, including the transaction’s time,
																		dollar amount, and participants. (More on how this happens in a second.)
																		</p></dd>
																		<dd><p>6.	That transaction must be stored in a block. After your transaction has been verified as accurate, it gets the green light. The transaction’s dollar amount, your digital signature, and Amazon’s digital signature are all stored in a block. There, the transaction will likely join hundreds, or thousands, of others like it.</p></dd>
																		<dd><p>7.	That block must be given a hash. Not unlike an angel earning its wings, once all of a block’s transactions have been verified, it must be given a unique, identifying code called a hash.
																			The block is also given the hash of the most recent block added to the blockchain. Once hashed, the block can be added to the blockchain.
																			By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is “an open, distributed ledger that can record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way”.
																			</p></dd>
																			<dd><p><h4><li>History</li></h4></p></dd>
																			<dd><p>The first work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They wanted to implement a system where document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Bayer, Haber, and Stornetta incorporated Merkle trees to the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one block.
																				The first blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using the Hash cash like the method to add blocks to the chain without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party. The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.
																				In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the network, reached 20 GB (Gigabyte). In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size.
																				The words block and chain were used separately in Satoshi Nakamoto’s original paper but were eventually popularized as a single word, blockchain, by 2016.
																				</p></dd>
																				<dd><p><h4><li>Blockchain Explained</li></h4></p></dd>
																				<dd><p>A blockchain carries no transaction cost. (An infrastructure cost yes, but no transaction cost.) The blockchain is a simple yet ingenious way of passing information from A to B in a fully automated
																					and safe manner. One party to a transaction initiates the process by creating a block. This block is verified by thousands, perhaps millions of computers distributed around the net. The verified block is added to a chain, which is stored across the net, creating not just a unique record, but a unique record with a unique history. Falsifying a single record would mean falsifying the entire chain in millions of instances. That is virtually impossible. Bitcoin uses this model for monetary transactions, but it can be deployed in many other ways.
																					</p></dd>
																					<dd><p>Think of a railway company. We buy tickets on an app or the web. The credit card company takes a cut for processing the transaction. With blockchain, not only can the railway operator save on credit card processing fees, it can move the entire ticketing process to the blockchain. The two parties in the transaction are the railway company and the passenger. The ticket is a block, which will be added to a ticket blockchain. Just as a monetary transaction on the blockchain is a unique, independently verifiable and unfalsifiable record (like Bitcoin), so can your ticket be. Incidentally, the final ticket blockchain is also a record of all transactions for, say, a certain train route, or even
																						the entire train network, comprising every ticket ever sold, every journey ever taken.
																						But the key here is this: it’s free. Not only can the blockchain transfer and store money, but it can also replace all processes and business models that rely on charging a small fee for a transaction or any other transaction between two parties.
																						Blockchain may make selling recorded music profitable again for artists by cutting out music companies and distributors like Apple or Spotify. The music you buy could even be encoded in the blockchain itself, making it a cloud archive for any song purchased. Because the amounts charged can be so small, subscription and streaming services will become irrelevant.
