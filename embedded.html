															An embedded system is a computer system—a combination of a computer processor, computer memory, and input/output peripheral devices—that has a dedicated function within a larger mechanical or electronic system. It is embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts. Because an embedded system typically controls physical operations of the machine that it is embedded within, it often has real-time computing constraints. Embedded systems control many devices in common use today. In 2009, it was estimated that ninety-eight percent of all microprocessors manufactured were used in embedded systems.
	
	Modern embedded systems are often based on microcontrollers (i.e. microprocessors with integrated memory and peripheral interfaces), but ordinary microprocessors (using external chips for memory and peripheral interface circuits) are also common, especially in more complex systems. In either case, the processor(s) used may be types ranging from general purpose to those specialized in a certain class of computations, or even custom designed for the application at hand. A common standard class of dedicated processors is the digital signal processor (DSP).
	
	Since the embedded system is dedicated to specific tasks, design engineers can optimize it to reduce the size and cost of the product and increase its reliability and performance. Some embedded systems are mass-produced, benefiting from economies of scale.</p><p>
	
	Embedded systems range in size from portable personal devices such as digital watches and MP3 players to bigger machines like home appliances, industrial assembly lines, robots, transport vehicles, traffic light controllers, and medical imaging systems. Often they constitute subsystems of other machines like avionics in aircraft and astrionics in spacecraft. Large installations like factories, pipelines and electrical grids rely on multiple embedded systems networked together. Generalized through software customization, embedded systems such as programmable logic controllers frequently comprise their functional units.
	
	Embedded systems range from those low in complexity, with a single microcontroller chip, to very high with multiple units, peripherals and networks, which may reside in equipment racks or across large geographical areas connected via long-distance communications lines.</p></dd>

														<dd><p>➢ Sensor − It measures the physical quantity and converts it to an electrical signal which can be read by an observer or by any electronic instrument like an A2D converter. A sensor stores the measured quantity to the memory.</p></dd>
														
														<dd><p>➢ A-D Converter − An analog-to-digital converter converts the analog signal sent by the sensor into a digital signal. A device that converts analog signals (usually voltage) obtained from environment(physical) phenomena into digital format.</p></dd>
														<dd><p>➢ Processor & ASICs − Processors process the data to measure the output and store it to the memory. Although CPUs and microcontrollers are also custom designed, they fall under general purposes.</p></dd>
			
														<dd><p>➢ D-A Converter − A digital-to-analog converter converts the digital data fed by the processor to analog data. A device converts digital input signal into an analog output signal.</p></dd>
														<dd><p>➢ Actuator − An actuator compares the output given by the D-A Converter to the actual (expected) output stored in it and stores the approved output. This device that produces a motion by converting energy and signals going into systems.</p></dd>
