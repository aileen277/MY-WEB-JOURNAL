														<dt><p><h3>➢ Explain Nanoscale? Compare it with meters? Give examples in Nanoscale?</h3></p></dt>
														<dd><p>Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is
															about 1 to 100 nanometers. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of
															extremely small things and can be used across all the other science fields, such as chemistry,
															biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.
															</p></dd>
															<dt><p><h3>How it started</h3></p></dt>
															<dd><p>The ideas and concepts behind nanoscience and nanotechnology started with a talk entitled
																“There’s plenty of room at the bottom” by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical
																Society meeting at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech) on December 29, 1959, long
																109
																before the term nanotechnology was used. In his talk, Feynman (see Figure 7.1) described a process
																in which scientists would be able to manipulate and control individual atoms and molecules. Over
																a decade later, in his explorations of ultraprecision machining, Professor Norio Taniguchi coined
																the term nanotechnology. It wasn’t until 1981, with the development of the scanning tunneling
																microscope that could “see” individual atoms, that modern nanotechnology began.
																</p></dd>
																<dt><p><h3>Fundamental concepts in Nanoscience and Nanotechnology</h3></p></dt>
																<dd><p>It’s hard to imagine just how small nanotechnology is. One nanometer is a billionth of a meter or
																	10-9
																	of meters. Here are a few illustrative examples:
																	</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>There are 25,400,000 nanometers in an inch</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ A sheet of newspaper is about 100,000 nanometers thick</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ On a comparative scale, if a marble were a nanometer, then one meter would be the size of
																		the Earth
																		</p></dd>
																		<dt><p>Nanoscience and nanotechnology involve the ability to see and to control individual atoms and
																			molecules. Everything on Earth is made up of atoms—the food we eat, the clothes we wear, the
																			buildings and houses we live in, and our own bodies.
																			But something as small as an atom is impossible to see with the naked eye. In fact, it’s impossible
																			to see with the microscopes typically used in high school science classes. The microscopes needed
																			to see things at the nanoscale were invented relatively recently about 30 years ago.
																			As small as a nanometer is, it’s still large compared to the atomic scale. An atom has a diameter of
																			about 0.1 nm. An atom’s nucleus is much smaller about 0.00001 nm. Atoms are the building blocks
																			110
																			for all matter in our universe. You and everything around you are made of atoms. Nature has
																			perfected the science of manufacturing matter molecularly. For instance, our bodies are assembled
																			in a specific manner from millions of living cells. Cells are nature’s nanomachines. At the atomic
																			scale, elements are at their most basic level. On the nanoscale, we can potentially put these atoms
																			together to make almost anything.

																			<dt><p>In a lecture called “Small Wonders: The World of Nanoscience,” Nobel Prize winner Dr. Horst
																				Störmer said that the nanoscale is more interesting than the atomic scale because the nanoscale is
																				the first point where we can assemble something — it’s not until we start putting atoms together
																				that we can make anything useful.
																				People are interested in the nanoscale – because it is at this scale that the properties of materials
																				can be very different from those at a larger scale. We define nanoscience as the study of phenomena
																				and manipulation of materials at atomic, molecular and macromolecular scales, where properties
																				differ significantly from those at a larger scale; and nanotechnologies as the design,
																				characterization, production, and application of structures, devices, and systems by controlling
																				shape and size at the nanometer scale.
																				The properties of materials can be different at the nanoscale for two main reasons:
																				➢ First, nanomaterials have a relatively larger surface area when compared to the same mass
																				of material produced in a larger form. This can make materials more chemically reactive
																				(in some cases materials that are inert in their larger form are reactive when produced in
																				their nanoscale form), and affect their strength or electrical properties.
																				➢ Second, quantum effects can begin to dominate the behavior of matter at the nanoscale
																				particularly at the lower end – affecting the optical, electrical and magnetic behavior of
																				materials. Materials can be produced that are nanoscale in one dimension (for example,
																				nanowires, nanorods, and nanotubes), in two dimensions (plate-like shapes like
																				nanocoating, nanolayers, and graphene) or in all three dimensions (for example,
																				nanoparticles)
																				Today’s scientists and engineers are finding a wide variety of ways to deliberately make materials
																				at the nanoscale to take advantage of their enhanced properties such as higher strength, lighter
																				weight, increased control of light spectrum, and greater chemical reactivity than their larger-scale
																				counterparts.

																				<dt><p><h3>Applications of Nanotechnology:</h3></p></dt>
																				<dd><p>➢ Medicine: customized nanoparticles the size of molecules that can deliver drugs directly to
																					diseased cells in your body. When it’s perfected, this method should greatly reduce the
																					damage treatment such as chemotherapy does to a patient’s healthy cells.
																					</p></dd>
																					<dd><p>➢ Electronics: it has some answers for how we might increase the capabilities of electronics
																						devices while we reduce their weight and power consumption.
																						</p></dd>
																						<dd><p>➢ Food: it has an impact on several aspects of food science, from how food is grown to how
																							it is packaged. Companies are developing nanomaterials that will make a difference not
																							only in the taste of food but also in food safety and the health benefits that food delivery.
																							</p></dd>
																							<dd><p>➢ Agriculture: nanotechnology can possibly change the whole agriculture part and
																								nourishment industry anchor from generation to preservation, handling, bundling,
																								transportation, and even waste treatment.
																								</p></dd>
																								<dd><p>➢ Vehicle manufacturers: Much like aviation, lighter and stronger materials will be
																									valuable for making vehicles that are both quicker and more secure. Burning motors will
																									likewise profit from parts that are all the more hardwearing and higher temperature safe.
