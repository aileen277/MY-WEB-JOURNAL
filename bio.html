														<dt><p><h4>➢ What do you think biotechnology is all about? Just begin by defining the two words bio and technology?</h4></p></dt>
														
														<dd><p>It is the broad area of biology involving living systems and organisms to develop or make products, or “any technological application that uses biological systems, living organisms, or derivatives thereof, to make or modify products or processes for specific use”.
															At its simplest, biotechnology is technology based on biology – biotechnology harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. We have used the biological processes of microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy products.
															</p></dd>
															<dd><p>Brewing and baking bread are examples of processes that fall within the concept of biotechnology (use of yeast (= living organism) to produce the desired product). Such traditional processes usually utilize the living organisms in their natural form (or further developed by breeding), while
																the more modern form of biotechnology will generally involve a more advanced modification of the biological system or organism.
																</p></dd>
																<dd><p>One example of modern biotechnology is genetic engineering. Genetic engineering is the process of transferring individual genes between organisms or modifying the genes in an organism to remove or add a desired trait or characteristic.
																	Today, biotechnology covers many different disciplines (e.g. genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, etc.). New technologies and products are developed every year within the areas of e.g.
																	Medicine (development of new medicines and therapies), agriculture (development of genetically modified plants, biofuels, biological treatment) or industrial biotechnology (production of chemicals, paper, textiles, and food).
																	</p></dd>
																	<dt><p><h4 ><li>History</li>  </h4></p></dt>
																	<dd><p>When Edward Jenner invented vaccines and when Alexander Fleming discovered antibiotics, they were harnessing the power of biotechnology. And, of course, modern civilization would hardly be imaginable without the fermentation processes that gave us beer, wine, and cheese.
																		When he coined the term in 1919, the agriculturalist Karl Ereky described ‘biotechnology’ as “all lines of work by which products are produced from raw materials with the aid of living things.” In modern biotechnology, researchers modify DNA and proteins to shape the capabilities of living
																		cells, plants, and animals into something useful for humans. Biotechnologists do this by sequencing or reading, the DNA found in nature, and then manipulating it in a test tube – or, more recently, inside of living cells.

																		<dt><p><h4><li>Applications of Biotechnology</li></h4></p></dt>
																		<dd><p>➢ Agriculture (Green Biotechnology): Biotechnology had contributed a lot to modify the genes of the organism known as Genetically Modified Organisms such as Crops, Animals, Plants, Fungi, Bacteria, etc. Genetically modified crops are formed by the manipulation of DNA to introduce a new trait into the crops. These manipulations are done to introduce traits such as pest resistance, insect resistance, weed resistance, etc.</p></dd>
																		<dd><p>➢ Medicine (Medicinal Biotechnology): This helps in the formation of genetically modified insulin known as humulin. This helps in the treatment of a large number of diabetes patients. It has also given rise to a technique known as gene therapy. Gene therapy is a technique to remove the genetic defect in an embryo or child. This technique involves the transfer of a normal gene that works over the non-functional gene.</p></dd>
																		<dd><p>➢ Aquaculture Fisheries: It helps in improving the quality and quantity of fishes. Through biotechnology, fishes are induced to breed via gonadotropin-releasing hormone.</p></dd>
																		<dd><p>➢ Environment (Environmental biotechnology): is used in waste treatment and pollution prevention. Environmental biotechnology can more efficiently clean up many wastes than conventional methods and greatly reduce our dependence on methods for land-based disposal. Every organism ingests nutrients to live and produces by-products as a result.
																			Different organisms need different types of nutrients. Some bacteria thrive on the chemical components of waste products. Environmental engineers use bioremediation, the broadest application of environmental biotechnology, in two basic ways. They introduce nutrients to stimulate the activity of bacteria already present in the soil at a waste site or add new bacteria to the soil. The bacteria digest the waste at the site and turn it into harmless byproducts. After the bacteria consume the waste materials, they die off or return to their
																			normal population levels in the environment.
