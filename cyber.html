														<dt><p><h4>➢ Can you describe cybersecurity? Begin by defining the two words cyber and security?</h4></p></dt>
														<dd><p>It is the protection of computer systems from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.
															The field is becoming more important due to increased reliance on computer systems, the Internet and wireless network standards such as Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, and due to the growth of smart devices, including smartphones, televisions, and the various devices that constitute the Internet of Things. Due to its complexity, both in terms of politics and technology, cybersecurity
															is also one of the major challenges in the contemporary world.
															</p></dd>
															<dd><p>Cybersecurity is often confused with information security but it focuses on protecting computer systems from unauthorized access or being otherwise damaged or made inaccessible. Information security is a broader category that looks to protect all information assets, whether in hard copy or
																in digital form.
																The term cybercrime is used to describe an unlawful activity in which computer or computing devices such as smartphones, tablets, Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs), etc. which are standalone or a part of a network are used as a tool or/and target of criminal activity. It is often committed by the people of destructive and criminal mindset either for revenge, greed or adventure. Combating this is a multi-disciplinary affair that spans hardware and software through to policy and people all of it aimed at both preventing cyber crimes occurring in the first place, and minimizing its impact when it does.
																</p></dd>
																<dd><p><h4>Cybersecurity Measures</h4></p></dd>
																<dt><p><h5>The following are some security measures to be taken to prevent cybercrimes:</h5></p></dt>
																<dd><p>➢ Staff awareness training: – Human error is the leading cause of data breaches, so you need to equip staff with the knowledge to deal with the threats they face. Training courses will show staff how security threats affect them and help them apply best-practice advice to real-world situations.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Application security: – Web application vulnerabilities are a common point of intrusion for cybercriminals. As applications play an increasingly critical role in business, it is vital to focus on web application security.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Network security: – Network security is the process of protecting the usability and integrity of your network and data. This is achieved by conducting a network penetration test, which scans your network for vulnerabilities and security issues.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Leadership commitment: – Leadership commitment is the key to cyber resilience. Without it, it is very difficult to establish or enforce effective processes. Top management must be prepared to invest in appropriate cybersecurity resources, such as awareness training.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Password management: – Almost half of the UK population uses ‘password’, ‘123456’ or ‘qwerty’ as their password. You should implement a password management policy that provides guidance to ensure staff create strong passwords and keep them secure.</p></dd>
																<dt><p><h4>Types of cybersecurity threats</h4></p></dt>
																<dd><p>➢ Ransomware: – It is a type of malicious software. It is designed to extort money by blocking access to files or the computer system until the ransom is paid. Paying the ransom does not guarantee that the files will be recovered or the system restored.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Malware:- it is a type of software designed to gain unauthorized access or to cause damage to a computer.</p></dd>
																<dd><p>➢ Social engineering: – it is a tactic that adversaries use to trick you into revealing sensitive information. They can solicit a monetary payment or gain access to your confidential data.
																	Social engineering can be combined with any of the threats listed above to make you more likely to click on links, download malware, or trust a malicious source.
																	</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ Phishing: – it is the practice of sending fraudulent emails that resemble emails from reputable sources. The aim is to steal sensitive data like credit card numbers and login information. It’s the most common type of cyber-attack. You can help protect yourself through education or a technology solution that filters malicious emails.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p><h4>Benefits of Cybersecurity</h4></p></dd>
																	<dt><p><h5>Benefits of utilizing cybersecurity include:</h5></p></dt>
																	<dd><p>➢ Business protection against malware, ransomware, phishing, and social engineering.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ Protection for data and networks.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ Prevention of unauthorized users.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ Improves recovery time after a breach.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ Protection for end-users.</p></dd>
																	<dd><p>➢ Improved confidence in the product for both developers and customers.</p></dd>
																	<dt><p><h4>Cybersecurity Vendors</h4></p></dt>
																	<dd><p>Vendors in cybersecurity fields will typically use endpoint, network and advanced threat protection
																		security as well as data loss prevention. Three commonly known cybersecurity vendors include Cisco, McAfee, and Trend Micro.
